The file containning all actor and actor system called project scala in the directory :
\src\main\scala\com\UsefulPack
The code is commented.
There are four actors :
•	Cash actor where I implemented a cashing strategy
•	Key-Value store where a slow in-memory cash is created
•	File-actor where I store the values in file
•	ConsoleReader actor for reading commands
then I have a class for a client and a systemactor to manage the operations.
Note that I have stopped at day 3. If you want to test the code without the client you can uncomment the command line that send a request to consoleReader in the app.
